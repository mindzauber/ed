  <h1>hi.</h1>

<p>
  why is it important to talk about taboos?
  taboos work with fear. taboos tie energy. taboos makes people behave in always the same (probably unwanted) way. we are trapped in this pattern. if we let go a certain taboo we gain energy. because we are able to decide again - instead of being trapped. let's look at it, understand it, play with it and change it. why not? it could be easy, baby!
